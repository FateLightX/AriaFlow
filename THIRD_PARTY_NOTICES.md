### Replacing A Sidecar

1. Download the matching upstream release asset and its published checksum file.
2. Verify the asset checksum before installation.

4. Update this notice with version, URLs, asset names, and SHA-256 values.
5. Run `scripts/verify_release.sh` before committing the replacement.

The generated application archive retains these notices through the repository source and GitHub Release attachments. Distributors must preserve the GPL notice and make the corresponding upstream source available with the sidecar distribution.
